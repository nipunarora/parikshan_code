*Apache httpd version around 2.0.4? (2.0.45, 2.0.48 both buggy)

program description:
-----------------------
Httpd is an open source Web Server

bug explanation:
----------------------
datarace (atomicity violation) bug 

This is reported in apache bugzilla as #25520

This code region includes more than one atomicity violation (datarace) bugs.
One thread's read-write sequence may falsely mingle with another thread's
read-write sequence to the same shared variable, leading to program's misbehavior. 

Specifically, the bug is in modules/loggers/mod_log_config.c
The bug is very obvious. In the ap_buffered_log_writer function,
buf->outcnt is the indx to the end of the log buffer. In the fuction,
it is read, checked, and then used to help append the log buffer,
  after the log buffer update (memcpy line), the buf->outcnt is increased.
The whole process is not protected by lock. As a result, the other thread
may be doing the same operation and the buf->outcnt and consequently the
buffer is totally mess, if bug triggered.

For more details about the function, please refer to figure 2 of Min's SVD 
paper@PLDI'05.
Or Figure 4 in avio paper @ASPLOS'06 (apache2.eps).

Source code:
-----------------
I used httpd-2.0.48 and httpd-2.0.45 before
You can download it from apache website
http://archive.apache.org/dist/httpd/httpd-2.0.48.tar.gz
or you can use the one in this folder:
 httpd-2.0.45.tar.gz
 httpd-2.0.48.tar.gz

How to trigger the bug:
------------------------
1.Configure the httpd-2.0.48 as follows: 
 ./configure --prefix = ... --with-mpm=worker
(--with-mpm will set the apache in multi-thread instead of multi-process mode;
 you may also want to add CPPFLAGS="-g" CXXFLAGS="-g" CFLAGS="-g" to give gdb
 debugging information)

2. add one line to the configuration file conf/httpd.conf: 
BufferedLogs on

3. Install httpd following its direction

4. Then you just need to send httpd request for two (different) files 
Please keep sending them concurrently

You can either use tools like httperf
./httperf  --server=<your-httpd-server-name>  --uri=/index.html.cz.iso8859-2 --num-conns=100 --num-calls=100
./httperf  --server=<your-httpd-server-name>  --uri=/index.html.en --num-conns=100 --num-calls=100

Or just use
> wget <file name>

5. If the bug is triggered, you'll see the garbage in the access log file 
logs/access_log

6. How the bug would manifest depends on how the code region would be falsely
interleaved.

One way:
If the interleaving is like:
thread1--memcpy (s, strs[i], strl[i]); (the memcpy in else)
thread2--memcpy (s, strs[i], strl[i]);  (the memcpy in else)
thread2--buf->outcnt += len;
thread1--buf->outcnt += len;
--At this point, buffer is inconsistent with buf->outcnt
  Next buffer write would make log looks strange

Another way:
If the interleaving is like:
thread1--if (len + buf->outcnt > LOG_BUFSIZE);
thread2--if (len + buf->outcnt > LOG_BUFSIZE);
thread1--memcpy...; buf->outcnt +=len;
thread2--memcpy... (buffer overflow may happen at this time)
  (If you change the macro LOG_BUFSIZE value (make it smaller),
   the buffer overflow may be easier to happen)

You can try to add some code to enforce above interleavings to expose the bug.

bug detection preliminary results:
---------------------
lockset, happen-before, SVD and avio can all detect this bug.

---------info. about httpd--------------
----------------------------------------
httpd is releatively easy to install, but you need root priviledge
to run it and write the /etc/*.cnf file.

configuration file is at conf/httpd.conf

wget and GET are the easy ways to exercise httpd 

By default, the files are in htdocs
