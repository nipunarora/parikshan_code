NTools traffic generator/analyzer package for Linux v1.5
(C) 2002-2010, Norbert Vegh, ntools@norvegh.com


Changes
-------
v.1.5:
NTools now supports the CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT kernel patch.
With this patch active wating for ngen and nemud is not required.
Support for multicast.
The sending and receiving interface must be set for ngen and nrecv.
All delay and jitter values are shown in millisec.
The logfile format has been cleaned up.
Packets are sent with a specific data pattern and the receiver actually checks whether
the packets were sent by ngen or not. Foreign packets are ignored.
A bug has been fixed related to displaying percentile statistics. Now only those percentiles
are displayed that were defined.
A bug has been fixed with TCP streams. Now the TCP ACKS are sent with the correct
IP precedence value.
Lost TCP sessions now are automatically restored if possible.
The level parameters are gone, packet size and rates are on L2 (Ethernet-level) now.
For TCP streams nrecv shows goodput.
A number of bugfixes and other small changes.

v1.4.1:
A minor bug has been fixed. When writing statistics to a file the first timestamp was
occasionally incorrect.
A new option gives the possibility to select whether L2 or L3 rates shall be displayed.

v1.4:
New network emulation tool, nemu is added, that emulates loss, delay and jitter for
impairment testing.
nrecv now uses real-time scheduler which gives much better jitter accuracy.
This feature requires a 2.6 kernel.

v1.3:
VLAN support has been added for UDP streams. Configurable VLAN ID and p-bits.

v1.2:
Now rates can be specified up to 1 Gbps.

v1.1:
The code has been fixed, now it compiles on RH 8.0 with gcc 3.


Documentation
-------------
See the man pages.


Installation
------------
Go to the src directory.
You can modify some built-in parameters in defs.h.
After you made your changes, you can edit the Makefile
to set your C++ compiler and installation directories.
The default compiler is gcc. The default installation
directory is /usr/local/bin for the binaries, and
/usr/local/man for the man pages.
Type 'make' and 'make install'.
If you ever want to uninstall the package,
type 'make uninstall'.


Requirements
------------
NTools runs only on Linux.
To be able to compile and use it, you need
a 2.6 or higher kernel with packet socket support.

To make use of the real-time scheduler for better delay measurements, and get rid of active waiting
install the CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT kernel patch. (https://rt.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page)
