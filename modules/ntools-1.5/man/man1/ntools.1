.SH NAME
.BR "ntools " "\- a traffic generator, analyzer and network emulator package for Linux"

.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR "ntools " "is a traffic generator, analyzer and network emulator package for Linux."
It can generate UDP and TCP streams with configurable characteristics,
and provide various statistics.
.BR "ntools " "can be used for testing network devices such as switches or routers.
You can use it for performance testing, latency measurements,
or Quality of Service testing.
.PP
It also includes a network emulator	tool that can emulate various loss, delay and jitter impairments.
.PP
.BR "ntools " "has many benefits:"
.IP "-" 3
.PPD 0
it is easy to use
.IP "-" 3
you can configure many streams, and see individual real-time statistics for each of them
.IP "-" 3
it supports real TCP streams with flow control
.IP "-" 3
.PPD
at last, but not very least, it is free
.PP
The package contains several programs.
.PP
.B NGEN AND NRECV
.PP
.BR "ngen " "can generate arbitrary number of static UDP/TCP streams. The configurable"
stream parameters include packet size, rate, ToS value, source and destination IP address
.RB "and port. " "nrecv " "terminates the streams generated by " "ngen "
and provides the following stream statistics: transferred rate, packet loss,
packet misordering, delay (latency), and jitter. Multicast sending and receiving is supported.
.PP
.B NSERVER AND NCLIENT
.PP
.BR "nserver " "and " "nclient " "can be used to emulate web-like traffic."
The client application starts new downloads with a Poisson process.
The byte size of the downloads are determined based on a distribution file which
contains file sizes and their relative probability. The client application
provides download time statistics for each file size.
.PP
.B NEMUD AND NEMU
.PP
.B nemud
is the network emulator daemon of
.BR ntools ". It can forward traffic between two interfaces,"
and it can emulate different kind of errors, including loss, delay and jitter impairments.
.RB "The" " nemu" " client is used to manipulate the impairment settings of the daemon.
