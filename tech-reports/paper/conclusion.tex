\section{Conclusion \& Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}

%Quick bug resolution is an important requirement for any production system maintenance effort.
%Existing techniques either add substantial overhead making them impractical in real-world systems, or are unable to capture enough trace information to localize the bug offline. 

We presented \parikshan a framework to do live-debugging and analysis of large scale systems.
\parikshan presents a novel technique to debug systems in real-time allowing for fast bug resolution.
We show several case-studies to see how our system can be applied on real problems. 


In the future, we wish to explore \parikshan further in 3 key areas: (1). Application: we aim to apply our system to real-time intrusion detection, and fault tolerance testing.
(2). Analysis: we wish to define ``real-time'' data analysis techniques for traces and instrumentation done in \parikshan.
We believe with streaming data analytic techniques, we can do much better than execution tracing/profiling.
(3). Live Cloning: we plan to reduce the suspend time of ``live cloning'', by applying optimizations suggested in several recent works in live migration.
To verify our implementation in a enterprise level public cloud provider, we also implemented a prototype of \parikshan on Google's Cloud Infrastructure (Google Compute~\cite{gcompute}), we plan to use this prototype in future publications for scaled out testing. 
%Running a clone in the same machine as the production container opens several venues such as copy-on-write migration, and asynchronous container syncing etc.
