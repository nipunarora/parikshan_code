One of the biggest problems faced by developers debugging large scale systems is replicating the deployed environment to figure out errors. 
Additionally, many modern companies are combining their development and operation management activities (DevOps), which has led to an increased emphasis on fast bug resolution. 
In this work we present \textit{``live-debugging''}, a mechanism which allows debugging a production system (run test-cases, debug, or profile, etc.) on-the-fly. 
%in a sandbox environment cloned from the live running system. 
The paper leverages user-space containers (OpenVZ/LXC) to launch containers cloned and migrated from running instances of an application, thereby launching two containers: \textit{production} (which provides the real output), and \textit{debug-container} (for debugging). 
This \emph{debug-container} provides a sandbox environment for debugging without any perturbation to the execution environment. 
%Our sandboxes provide name-space, and resource management for the processes executing the test/debug cases. 
Customized network-proxy agents replicate or replay network inputs from clients to both the production and debug-container, as well as safely discard all network output from the debug-container. 
The sandboxed debug-container can be run either on the same physical host as the production container, or scaled out on dedicated physical debug servers. 
We used our system, called \texttt{Parikshan}, to do \textit{``live-debugging''} on several real-world bugs, and effectively reduced debugging complexity and time.
%We believe our tool provides a mechanism for practical live-debugging of large scale multi-tier and cloud applications, without requiring any application down-time, and minimal performance impact.

%In recent years there has been a lot of work in record-and-replay systems which captures traces from live production systems, and replays them.
%However, most such record-replay systems have a high recording overhead and are still not practical to be used in production environments without paying a penalty in terms of user-experience.
