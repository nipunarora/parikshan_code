%Existing Testing and Verification technologies, are impractical for testing large scale softwares. 
One of the biggest problems faced by developers debugging large scale systems is replicating the deployed environment to figure out errors.
In recent years there has been a lot of work in record-and-replay systems which captures traces from live production systems, and replays them.
However, most such record-replay systems have a high recording overhead and are still not practical to be used in production environments without paying a penalty in terms of user-experience. 

In this work we present a harness for production systems which allows users to debug the target system (run test-cases, or profile etc.) in a sandbox environment in the wild at any point in it's execution
% of a service oriented application. 
The paper leverages, User-Space Containers(OpenVZ/LXCs) to launch a container cloned and migrated from a running instances of an application. 
This \emph{test-container} provides a sandbox environment, for safe execution of test-cases/debugging done by the users without any perturbation to the execution environment. 
%Test cases are initiated using user-defined probe points which launch test-cases using the execution context of the probe point. 
Our sandboxes provide a separate namespace for the processes executing the test cases, replicate and copy inputs to the parent application, safely discard all outputs, and manage the file system such that existing and newly created file descriptors are safely managed.
%Further we explain fidelity guarantees of our proposed system
We believe our tool provides a mechanism for practical debugging of large scale multi-tier and cloud applications, without requiring any application down-time.
In our evaluation provide a number of use-cases to show the utility of our tool.
