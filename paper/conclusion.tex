\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper we described \parikshan a mechanism to do live-debugging of large scale systems.
\parikshan is a novel technique to debug live systems allowing faster times to reach bug resolution.
We evaluated \parikshan on real-world scenarios to show it's applicability and discussed several modes in which it can be used.
