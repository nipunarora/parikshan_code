\noindent
Quick bug resolution is an important requirement for any production system maintenance effort.
Existing techniques either add substantial overhead detering their application in real-world systems, or are unable to capture enough trace information to easily localize the bug offline. 

\noindent
We have presented \parikshan a mechanism to do live-debugging and analysis of large scale systems.
\parikshan is a novel technique to debug live systems allowing faster times to reach bug resolution.
We evaluated \parikshan on real-world scenarios to show it's applicability \& discussed several modes in which it can be used.

%We would like to acknowledge Qiang Xu, Abhishek Sharma, and Pallavi Joshi for their insight and feedback in designing \parikshan, and in the evaluation of this technology.
