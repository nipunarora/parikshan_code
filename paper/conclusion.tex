\section{Conclusion and Acknowledgements}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper we described \parikshan a mechanism to do live-debugging of large scale systems.
\parikshan is a novel technique to debug live systems allowing faster times to reach bug resolution.
We evaluated \parikshan on real-world scenarios to show it's applicability and discussed several modes in which it can be used.

We would like to acknowledge ... for their insight and feedback in designing \parikshan, and in the evaluation of this technology.
