There have been several existing approaches that look into testing applications in the wild. 
The related work can be divided in several categories:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Perpetual Testing}
    We are inspired by the notion of perpetual testing\cite{perpetual} which advocates that software testing should be key part of the deployment phase and not just restricted to the development phase.
  \item \textbf{Record and Replay}
  \item \textbf{Alpha-Beta Testing}  
\end{itemize}
