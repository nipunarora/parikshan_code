\subsection{Motivationg Scenario}
\label{sec:motivation}

In Figure \ref{fig:motivation}, we have shown two workflows of the same system running with \parikshan, and without \parikshan.
To further explain, let us take  user Joe who is an administrator, and IT manager for a multi-tiered system. 
Much like several IT systems user Joe has a dashboard which informs him of the health status of all of his applications, and provides him with high level statistical views of all tiers of the system.
At time t0, Joe observes an unusually high memory usage by tierA for transaction type X or unusually high latencies in fetch operations for user Y (Alternatively, a trouble ticket could have been generated by the user).
Under usual circumstances, the system would have to go down(depending on the severity of the problem), the problem debugged using offline testing,  and the system would be patched once the problem has been diagnosed.
However often, it is difficult to find out the confiugration of the system, and the user input which is causing this problem, also solving any emergent problems as soon as possible is extremely important.

Joe can now use \parikshan, to fork off a clone of tierA as test-tierA. 
Our proxy balancer sends a copy of the incoming request to test-tierA, while users can continue using tierA. 
Process in test-tierA follow the same execution paths, as they receive the same input(we discuss non-determinisim related issues later); 
this allows Joe to initiate deeper test-cases, and observe the test-tierA, without fearing any problems in the user-facing operations.

% This paragraph needs serious revision - the points have been noted down but they need to be stated clearly in a better manner.
One of the key advantages of such an online approach is a reduced time to bug resolution.
Time to bug resolution is usually a very important criteria in any user-facing service oriented application, as the longer a bug remains the system, the more it is going to hit the user perception/revenue.
Bearing this in my mind we believe, that online testing will be an important aspect towards modern applications.
Additionally the usage of redundant computing for testing in A/B testing(see section \ref{sec:related}) approaches is a well accepted paradigm in real-world applications.
This leads us to believe that using redundant computing should be acceptable for regular testing approaches as well.

\subsection{Motivation Questions?}

To further motivate our testing paradigm we have come up with a set of motivating questions:

%\begin{compactitem}
%\setlength{\itemsep}{1Pt}
%\item[]\textbf{Q1:} Is it important to sandbox test-cases?
%\item[]\textbf{Q2:} Is recreating production environment difficult? 
%\item[]\textbf{Q3:} Is redundant computing available? 
%\item[]\textbf{Q4:} How would executing test-cases in a production server effect user-experience?
%\end{compactitem}

\subsubsection{\textbf{Q1:} Is it persistent testing important?}
\subsubsection{\textbf{Q2:} Is recreating production environment difficult?}
\subsubsection{\textbf{Q3:} Can redundant computing be utilized for testing?}
\subsubsection{\textbf{Q4:} How would executing test-cases in a production server effect user-experience?}
