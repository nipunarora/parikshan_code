Live debugging is a proposed mechanism for real-time bug diagnosis in an active production system, with the assistance of live migration/cloning technologies in virtualized environments.
The technique has two key advantages: firstly, it provides a budget upper-bound for overhead/slowdown caused due to debugging tools, and secondly, any modifications made in the debugging environment is not visible to the end-user.
In this paper, we present debugging methodologies that can be applied for live debugging. 
We look at how statistical debugging can be applied for live debugging scenarios.
