\section{Budget based adaptive debugging}
\label{sec:adaptive}

Low runtime overheads are critical when programs are deployed in production environments.
In actual production systems, even marginal slowdown in execution time or increase in resource consumption is unacceptable. 
\livedebugging allows for significantly larger overheads for debugging applications.
Previous approaches for statistical debugging have use sparse random sampling of predicate profiles to reduce the overhead of instrumentation.
Statistical debugging relies on a large number of both failing and successful runs of the program to build a representative profile.
On the other hand, profile sampling relies on observing path profiles in finding
