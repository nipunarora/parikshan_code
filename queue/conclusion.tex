\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper we have modeled relationship between resources, arrival rates, and service processing times of debug-containers, with it's corresponding debug-window in our live debugging framework.
The model uses queuing theory to compute the slack available in the system, and shows that in a system not running at full capacity, there is significant slack available for instrumentation, which would not lead to a buffer overflow.
