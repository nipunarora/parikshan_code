\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper we have modeled upper bounds for instrumentation of debug-containers in our live debugging framework.
The model uses queuing theory to utilize the slack available in these systems to the maximum.
This allows for the debugger to gain as much context as possible from the program without leading to a buffer overflow.
