Short time-to-bug localization, and resolution is extremely important for any 24x7 service-oriented application.
%Modern 24x7 SOA applications rely on short deployment cycles, and fast bug resolution to maintain their services. 
%Hence, time-to-bug localization is extremely important for any such application.
In this work, we present \livedebugging, a mechanism which allows debugging of production systems (run test-cases, debug, or profile, etc.) on-the-fly. 
We leverage user-space virtualization technology (OpenVZ/LXC), to launch containers cloned and migrated from running instances of an application, thereby having two containers: \textit{production} (which provides the real output), and \textit{debug} (for debugging). 
The \debugcontainer provides a sandbox environment for debugging without any perturbation to the production environment. 
Customized network-proxy agents replicate or replay network inputs from clients to both the production and debug-container, as well as safely discard all network output from the debug-container. 
We used our system, called \texttt{Parikshan}, on several real-world bugs, and effectively reduced debugging complexity and time.

%One of the biggest problems faced by developers debugging large scale systems is replicating the deployed environment to figure out errors. 
%Additionally, many modern companies are combining their development and operation management activities (DevOps), which has led to an increased emphasis on fast bug resolution. 
%in a sandbox environment cloned from the live running system. 
%Our sandboxes provide name-space, and resource management for the processes executing the test/debug cases. 
%The sandboxed debug-container can be run either on the same physical host as the production container, or scaled out on dedicated physical debug servers. 
%We believe our tool provides a mechanism for practical live-debugging of large scale multi-tier and cloud applications, without requiring any application down-time, and minimal performance impact.

%In recent years there has been a lot of work in record-and-replay systems which captures traces from live production systems, and replays them.
%However, most such record-replay systems have a high recording overhead and are still not practical to be used in production environments without paying a penalty in terms of user-experience.
