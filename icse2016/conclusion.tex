\section{Conclusion \& Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}

%Quick bug resolution is an important requirement for any production system maintenance effort.
%Existing techniques either add substantial overhead making them impractical in real-world systems, or are unable to capture enough trace information to localize the bug offline. 

%We presented \parikshan a framework to do live-debugging and analysis of large scale systems.
\parikshan is a novel framework to debug systems in real-time allowing for fast bug resolution.
We have shown the applicability of \parikshan in  7 real-world case studies, and shown how it can be used to quickly localize the error.

In the future, we wish to explore \parikshan further in 3 key areas: (1). Application: we aim to apply our system to real-time intrusion detection and statistical debugging.
(2). Analysis: we wish to define ``real-time'' data analysis techniques for traces and instrumentation done in \parikshan.
%We believe with streaming data analytic techniques, we can do much better than execution tracing/profiling.
(3). We plan to reduce the suspend time of live cloning, by utilizing several recent works in live migration.
We also tested \parikshan on Google's Cloud Infrastructure (Google Compute~\cite{gcompute}) and plan to use this for future work. 
%Running a clone in the same machine as the production container opens several venues such as copy-on-write migration, and asynchronous container syncing etc.

An extended version of the paper is present in CUCS Tech Reports~\cite{parikshanTR,parikshanQueue}, details about the project, and source code is available on github~\cite{github}.
