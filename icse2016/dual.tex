\subsection{Synchronized Execution}
\label{sec:dualExecution}

In this section we briefly describe an alternate design choice for synchronously executing the production and the debug execution.
One of the primary goals of \parikshan is to avoid any overhead in the production execution. 
However, in this section we relax this constraint, and opt for synchronized execution of the production and debug container using instrumentation and tracing in the production environment.
