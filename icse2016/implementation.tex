%\parikshan is built on top of user-space container virtualization software, OpenVZ~\cite{openvz}, with Centos 6.5 with Linux Kernel 2.6.32.
%Each container disk layout uses ploop~\cite{ploop} devices to enable faster and easier cloning.
%The OpenVZ functionality, was extended to enable live-cloning as explained in section \ref{sec:design}.
%We modified and used the OpenVZ toolkit vzctl version 4.8 to create our cloning, creation and destroy scripts for the container. 
%While the technology has also been tested on Debian systems, the evaluation in this paper has been done on RHEL(Centos) Systems. 
%For our evaluation, we have not put in resource restriction on the containers (i.e. the containers have access to the same hardware resources as the host machine).
%Users using \parikshan may put resource restriction as required.
%\parikshan also requires a number of commonly available linux modules to allow for network connectivity and

\parikshan is built on top of user-space container virtualization software, OpenVZ~\cite{openvz}, with Centos 6.5 with Linux Kernel 2.6.32.
We implemented the system in 3 different configurations: 
(1). We applied \parikshan 's internal mode configuration by installing it in a single host OS VM with Intel i7 CPU, with 4 Cores, and 16GB RAM. 
%\parikshan was installed on multiple VM's running on the host OS using KVM based virtualization. 
Containers were cloned within the machine, with a seperate VM acting as the client.
We used NAT, and IP namespaces for network access to the VM's.
(2). We impelemted our system's external mode on the base kernel in identical host nodes. 
Each of these host nodes have an Intel Core 2 Duo Processor, 8GB of RAM, and ran Centos 6.5 with Linux Kernel 2.6.32.
%(3). To verify our implementation in a enterprise level public cloud provider, we also implemented a prototype on Google's Cloud Infrastructure (Google Compute~\cite{gcompute}).
%The production and the debug container's were run on different virtual nodes, with 2 VCPU's and 4G RAM. 
%The main advantage of using the Google Compute Engine was to run our cloning scripts on real data-centers, and also to scale out our evaluation. 

The network proxy was implemented in C/C++.
The forwarding in the proxy is done by forking off multiple processes each handling one send/or receive connection in a loop.
Data from processes handling communication with the production container, is  transferred to those handling communication with the debug containers using pipes.
Pipe buffer size is a configurable input based on user-specifications.
