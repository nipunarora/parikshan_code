%Parikshan enables the users to freely run any test-case in the test-container while not effecting the production container. 
%At the same time the output of these tests should not effect the functionality or the performance of the production system.
%The main advantage of such a system can be seen in service oriented applications which are user facing and can hence ill-afford to be shutdown for inspecting bugs.
%As mentioned earlier, another major advantage is that we are able to capture live user-input. \\

\section{CaseStudy: Debugging using Execution Tracing of MySQL bug 15811}  
%Performance profiling such as function execution trace, execution time, resource usage etc., is often used to indicate and localize performance bugs in real world systems. 
%While performance profiling is simple to implement, it obviously incurs an overhead and will effect user-experience of the target system.
%Effectively, this means that despite it's advantages, the amount of profiling that can be done in a production system is extremely limited. 
%As our first case study we focused on profiling and capturing a performance bug in a session with several randomly created user transactions to MySQL. 
It was reported by users \cite{mysqlbug}, that some of the user requests for the MySQL server were running significantly slower than others.
To test out \parikshan to catch this bug, we re-created a 2 tier client-server setup with the server(container) running a buggy MySQL server application, and made a random workload with several repetitive instances of queries triggering the bug.
We initiated debugging by creating a live clone of the MySQL server container.
We profiled high granularity functions in MySQL and investigated progressively finer granularity modules to isolate the performance problem.
%This allowed us to successfully isolate the function with the performance problem.

Finally, we used breakpoints to go step by step into the function and observe its execution trace as well as object values.
We were able to find that for complex character sets like Chinese or Japenese, the string matching function was sub-optimal (had a lot of redundant computation).
We believe this case study shows a classical performance bug, where \parikshan can be beneficial.
%% FI Firstly, it's a performance bug which is non-critical i.e. does not lead to crashes.
%% FI This is important as \parikshan has been designed to look into real live bug diagnosis.
%\footnote{A lot of SOA applications are fault tolerant, and can continue even after the crash by relaunching processes etc. Potentially \parikshan can also be used in such a scenario to trace the crash itself.}
%% FI Secondly, we assume that the user-input (which caused the bug), occurs fairly frequently as described in the bug description.
%In this case, a database query which looks into data containing chinese characters, or japanese characters could be a fairly common occurence.
%In our experience we found several such performance bugs which occur in only a small percentage of user transactions.
%These bugs are often diffcult to catch as they happen only in corner case inputs, and generally do not lead to application crashes.
%\parikshan would be useful to debug such performance errors, by giving deep insight in a live running system.
